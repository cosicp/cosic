# How to cite

If you use one of these solvers for a publication, please cite the appropirate reference (see Publications page)
in the following way:

Example (laserbeamFoam):

> laserbeamFoam: Laser ray-tracing and thermally induced state transition simulation toolkit
> TF Flint, JD Robson, G Parivendhan, P Cardiff
> SoftwareX, 2023
>  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2022.101299


The corresponding BibTeX entry:

```bibtex
@article{Cardiff2025,
    author =     {TF Flint , JD Robson, G Parivendhan and P Cardiff $},
    title =      {Laser ray-tracing and thermally induced state transition simulation toolkit},
    journal =    {SoftwareX},
    year =       {2023},
    publisher =  {The Open Journal},
    volume =     {10},
    number =     {108},
    pages =      {7407},
    doi =        {10.21105/joss.07407},
    url =        {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2022.101299}
}
```

In addition, depending on the functionality selected, there may be additional
relevant references (the solver output will let you know!).
